This code creates a simple calculator using the Tkinter library in Python. Key concepts include:

1. **Tkinter**: This is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, used here to create the calculator’s graphical interface.
2. **Frames**: The `Frame` widget is used to hold other widgets. Here, `mainframe` and `inner` frames organize the layout.
3. **Entry Widget**: This is used to display and input text. It serves as the calculator’s display screen.
4. **Global Variables**: `first` and `op` store the first operand and the operation type, enabling multi-step calculations.
5. **Lambda Functions**: Used in button commands to pass arguments (`num`) to the `onclick` function.
6. **Grid Layout**: The `grid` method positions buttons in a grid, making the layout resemble a standard calculator.
7. **Event Handling**: Functions like `onclick`, `set_operation`, and `equal` manage user interactions, updating the display and performing calculations.

These concepts combine to create a functional and user-friendly calculator interface.
